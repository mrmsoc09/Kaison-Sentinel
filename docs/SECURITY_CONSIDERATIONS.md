# Security Considerations

- Default deny for network and active scanning.
- HiL required for execute and reporting.
- Evidence and screen recording required for validated findings.
- API auth optional but supported; rate limiting enabled by default.
- Encryption supported for runs and reports; plaintext requires `KAI_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT=1`.
