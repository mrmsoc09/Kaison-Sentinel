- **End‑to‑end autonomous pipeline**: plan → execute → parse → normalize → triage → validate → report → mitigate.
- **Evidence‑first validation**: no VALIDATED finding without screen recording + immutable evidence bundle.
- **Tiered mitigation output**: Minimal / Standard / Deep remediation with dry‑run + apply + verify + rollback steps.
- **Cross‑tool correlation**: reduce false positives by requiring multi‑signal confirmation.
- **Chained vulnerability reasoning**: link low‑severity issues into high‑impact chains with causal analysis.
- **Policy‑as‑code governance**: hard gates, scope enforcement, and HiL approvals.
- **Full auditability**: every agent action and decision logged, redacted, and reviewable.
- **Multi‑agent orchestration**: PraisonAI governance + Gemini/Codex/Claude/LLM circles for A/B execution.
- **Headless OSINT recon**: safe‑mode, scoped, automated reconnaissance at scale.
- **Plug‑and‑play modules**: modules can run in containers or plug into existing systems.
- **Cloud‑native mitigation**: first‑class CLI guidance for GCP, AWS, Azure, Cloudflare.
